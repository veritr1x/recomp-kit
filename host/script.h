// THE HOLD IS COUNTED IN PRESENTED FRAMES, THE TIMEOUT IN SCRIPT TIME
//
// `for <ms>` is written in milliseconds and converted to a number of PRESENTED
// FRAMES at the pinned step - 2000 ms is 40 frames at 50 ms - so every script
// shipped before this change means what it meant. `within <ms>` stays in
// script time.
//
// The two units are deliberate. The hold exists to outlast a fade, and a fade
// is a sequence of frames; measured in time it can be satisfied without any
// frames at all, because the pinned clock also advances when a guest spins on
// it without drawing (boot.cpp's stall breaker, 256 polls to a step). Under
// the pin the front end does exactly that while it waits for a sound cursor,
// so a hold measured in milliseconds was answered during a two-frame fade
// plateau and the click landed early - five pinned runs in twelve failed that
// way, with the same signature as the fixed-wait flake that preceded them.
// The timeout stays in time so that a guest which has genuinely stopped
// drawing still fails the run instead of waiting for frames that never come.
//                             hold the script here until the metric has been
//                             above the value for `for` milliseconds, giving
//                             up after `within` milliseconds. Both clauses are
//                             optional and may come in either order; the
//                             defaults are no hold and a minute. This is how a
//                             script waits for the GAME rather than for the
//                             clock: a `wait` is a guess about how long a
//                             machine takes to reach the menu, and a guess
//                             that was right for months stops being right the
//                             moment anything is added to startup.
//
//                             `for` is what makes it usable on a screen that
//                             fades in. A fade passes through every value on
//                             its way up, so a bare threshold can be met by a
//                             frame of the transition and answered half a
//                             second before the screen will take a click.

//                             if it has not taken effect within the timeout.
//                             Not a host-side resize: the game recreates its
//                             surfaces itself, and a shim that resized them
//                             underneath it would be testing something the
//                             game never does. The depth is 8 or 16, the two
//                             pixel formats the DirectDraw shim can describe.
//
//                             It ARMS rather than waits. The game applies a
//                             mode only when a level starts and it recreates
//                             its surfaces: measured, choosing 800 X 600 and
//                             leaving the options screen left the host at
//                             640x480x8, and it stayed there through New Game,
//                             the tutorial prompt and the whole level select.
//                             It changed when the level began, to
//                             "display mode: 800x600 16bpp" with 240436 draws
//                             at it. So a script says `mode` and then goes on
//                             to enter a level, and the run fails at the end
//                             if the mode never arrived - the same shape as an
//                             armed dump that never fired.
//
//                             The offered list comes from RECOMP_DDRAW_MODES,

//                             640x480x16 crashes the game. The front end runs
//                             at 640x480 in both depths and selects them
//                             without asking what is available or checking the
//                             refusal. Keep both in the list, or set the list
//                             at runtime once the game is up, which is what
